<h1>OpenMBTA</h1>

<p>The OpenMBTA project provides free, open source mobile apps for public
transportation users in the Boston metro region. The goal is to promote public
transportation in order to help fight global
warming and reduce our dependency on oil.  </p>

<h2>OpenMBTA for the iPhone</h2>

<p>
 You can get the OpenMBTA iPhone app from the iTunes App Store for free <%= link_to "by
clicking here", "itms://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=336082252&mt=8&s=143441" %>. 
The current version is <strong>1.3</strong>. The new version introduces a new
scrolling schedule view and multitasking support.
</p>

<p>OpenMBTA will show you today's scheduled and real-time arrival times for
MBTA buses, subway trains, commuter rail lines, and ferries. (Real-time information is available
for certain buses and subway lines.) It also shows you the latest service delay
announcements from the MBTA.</p>

<h2>How to use the iPhone app</h2>

<p>Let's just run through a basic use case. Say you're somewhere in
Cambridgeport, and you want to know where the nearest stop for the Number 1 Bus
to the Boston side of the Charles River is and when it's going to arrive next.</p>

<p>Starting at the main menu, you want to press <b>Bus</b>.</p> 

<p>The next screen will show you all the bus routes with trips still scheduled 
today, ordered by number. If the bus you're interested in has a high number, you
can navigate to it more quickly using the number index along the right. In this
case, we don't need to do that because Bus 1 is at the top of the list. </p>

<p>For every bus route, you'll see all the headsigns for that route. Usually
this means that there is one headsign for each direction, but some routes are
more complicated and have more than two headsigns. For each headsign, you'll
also see the number of trips left for today.</p>

<p> Please note that if a bus route isn't in service today, it won't show up at all on this list. </p>

<p>We've found Bus 1 going toward Boston, so let's tap that. </p>

<%= image_tag "screens/bus-routes-annotated.jpg", :class => "screenshot" %>

<p>The next screen is the heart of the application. It is actually two views.
By default, you'll see the map view. If you tap on the "Schedule"
button, you'll see a scrollable schedule. The map view will show real-time information when a real-time data
feed for that route is available; otherwise, it shows next scheduled arrival
times. The schedule view always presents scheduled arrival times.</p>

<%= image_tag "screens1.3/IMG_0008.jpg", :class => 'screenshot' %>

<%= render :partial => 'help/guide' %>


<p>
You can also bookmark routes using the bookmark button the top of the map or
schedule screens. Bookmarked routes will show up at the top of the main
menu.
</p>

<p>
Finally, check out the T-Alerts and the Twitter #mbta feed screens.
